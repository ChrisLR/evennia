# Setup quickstart

The Evennia server is installed, run and maintained from the terminal (console/CMD on Windows). Starting the
server doesn't make anything visible online. Once you download everything you can in fact develop your game
in complete isolation if you want, without needing any access to the internet.

## Installation

Evennia supports Python 3.7 to 3.9. As with most Python packages, using a
[virtualenv](../Glossary.md#virtualenv) is recommended in order to keep your
installation independent from the system libraries. It's _not_ recommended
to install Evennia as superuser.

```{warning}

   This is not yet available. Switch to the 0.9.5 version of these docs to install Evennia.
```

    pip install evennia

Make sure the `evennia` command works. Use `evennia -h` for usage help (or read on).

If you are having trouble, want to install in some other way (like with Docker)
or want to contribute to Evennia itself, check out the [Extended Installation
instructions](./Extended-Installation.md).  It also has a [troubleshooting
section](./Extended-Installation.md#troubleshooting) for different operating
systems.


## Initialize a new game

Use `cd` to enter a folder where you want to do your game development. Here (and in
the rest of the Evennia documentation) we call this folder `mygame`, but you should of course
name your game whatever you like:

    evennia --init mygame

This will create a new folder `mygame` (or whatever you chose) in your current location. This
contains empty templates and all the default settings needed to start the server.


## Start the new game

`cd` into your game folder (`mygame` in our case). Next, run

    evennia migrate

This will create the default database (Sqlite3). The database file ends up as `mygame/server/evennia.db3`. If you
ever want to start from a fresh database, just delete this file and re-run `evennia migrate` again.

    evennia start

Set your user-name and password when prompted. This will be the "god user" or "superuser" in-game. The email is optional.

If all went well, the server is now up and running. Point a legacy MUD/telnet client to `localhost:4000` or
a web browser at [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001) to play your new (if empty) game!

> If `localhost` doesn't work on your computer, use `127.0.0.1`, which is the same thing.


## See server logs

This will echol the server logs to the terminal as they come in:

    evennia --log

or

    evennia -l


You can also start logging immediately when running `evennia` commands, such as


    evennia start -l


To exit the log view, enter `Ctrl-C` (`Cmd-C` for Mac). This will not affect the server.


## Restarting and stopping


You can restart the server without disconnecting any connected players:

    evennia restart

To do a full stop and restart (will disconnect everyone):

    evennia reboot

Full stop of the server (will need to use `start` to activate it again):

    evennia stop
