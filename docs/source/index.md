```{warning}

  This is the **WIP** documentation for the
  development branch of Evennia (v1.0-dev). The text is based on the
  original Evennia `wiki <https://github.com.evennia/evennia/wiki>`_
  but it's being refactored heavily. There are known conversion issues
  and missing links. This will slowly be ironed out as this is developed.

  New things will be added to this version only, but for now you are best
  off using v0.9.5 of the docs, or the original wiki. You have been warned.
