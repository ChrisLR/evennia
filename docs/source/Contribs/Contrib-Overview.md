# Contrib modules

Contribs are found in [evennia/contrib/](evennia.contrib) and are optional game-specific code-snippets
or even full systems you can use for your game. They are contributed by the Evennia community and
released under the same license as Evennia itself. Each contrib has its own installation instructions.
Bugs are reported to the Evennia [issue tracker](github:issue) as usual.

has stalled a bit so we are looking for enthusiastic people to lead the charge.

- [evennia/ainneve repository](https://github.com/evennia/ainneve)

is maintained by Tehom in its own repository so bug reports should be directed there.

- [Arxcode repository on github](https://github.com/Arx-Game/arxcode)
- [Arxcode issue tracker](https://github.com/Arx-Game/arxcode/issues)
- [Arxcode installation help](./Arxcode-installing-help.md) - this may not always be fully up-to-date with
  latest Evennia. Report your findings!

### Evscaperoom

A full engine for making multiplayer 'escape-rooms' completely in code.
This is based on the 2019 MUD Game jam winner *Evscaperoom*.

  be played by entering the *evscaperoom* exit in the first Limbo room.
- https://github.com/Griatch/evscaperoom - the original game's source code (warning for spoilers if you
  want to solve the puzzles and mystery yourself).
