## Lessons for Part 2

In Part two of the Starting tutorial we'll step back and plan out the kind of tutorial
game we want to make. This is a more 'theoretical' part where we won't do any hands-on
programming.

1. Introduction & Overview (you are here)
1. [Where do I begin](./Planning-Where-Do-I-Begin.md)
1. [On planning a game](./Game-Planning.md)
1. [Planning to use some useful Contribs](./Planning-Some-Useful-Contribs.md)

In the process we'll go through the common questions of "where to start"
and "what to think about" when creating a multiplayer online text game.
